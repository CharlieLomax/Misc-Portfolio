## AI Samples
Contains several examples of code I wrote for my Intro to Artificial Intelligence course. `AIPlayer.java` is from a group project, though that file was primarily my work. The full project was an extended version of tic-tac-toe, which had an AI player that could compete with a human player. `Robot.java` was an individual project I completed; the skeleton was provided by the teaching staff and all of the algorithms were implemented by me. The goal of this program was to help a robot navigate a simulated grid map in the most optimal way. `Futoshiki.java` is a program designed to solve a Futoshiki puzzle (a Japanese logic puzzle similar to Soduku).

## Bomb Game Sample
Some code samples from the game I've been working on in my spare time, as well as a playable demo.

## Group 7 - HCI
A Figma file of the wireframe my group designed in my Human-Computer Interaction course for the NC Parks and Recreation vehicle inventory management webpage.

## Wordlist.c
From a project in my C class to read a list of words from a file and store them.

## Build-a-Bot Sample
This was a game project I worked on with a group in one of my classes. The project was for the nonprofit Katabasis.org, a non-profit with the goal of getting STEM educational resources to low-income children. This game was intended to get kids interested in PC-building. Most of my contribution to the project was the behavior of the player character, which is what I have included here, as well as a playable build of the game for Windows.

## HWE Senior Design Sample
This was my senior design project, a website for the How We Evaluate Lab. This website is meant to host a course to teach students critical thinking, where responses are graded automatically using NLP. I worked exclusively on the backend; the `nlp.py` and `unit_test.py` files are my work, and I and one of the other members of the team collabporated on the `assignment.py` file.

## Game Engine
This is from one of my courses, in which we spent the entire semester building a basic 2D game engine. The engine has numerous features, including multi-threading, client-server communication, an event and replay system, and scripting. `Game 1` and `Game 2` contain mostly the same code; the point of the two being separate is to demonstrate that the engine code can be repurposed for different games. To run the engine, both `Game Engine Project.exe` and `Game Server.exe` must be run at the same time (these can be found in the `Release` subfolder in each game's folder).
